Changemakers Voting Widget

This is the server-side Ruby applet that interfaces with the Changemakers.com API.  It creates an iframe-friendly graphically rich voting widget which can be embedded via javascript into external websites or featured independently.

Currently, this vode is not meant for end-users; but to be hosted by Changemakers.com.
